How to build a booster for the train API
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
To drive the trains, the Raspberry does not provide enough power. You therefore need an amplifier capable of amplifying the signal coming out of the Raspberry without modifying it.
This is the role of the booster.

.. Note::
   I was inspired by the schema used by `booster <https://github.com/hsanjuan/dccpi/blob/master/dcc_booster_schem.png>`_ and made some modifications to it

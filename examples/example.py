# See help (fallerlib.stept) for more information on the parameters that this function takes

# Each motor can be configured to operate at a specific speed. To retrieve the configured speed you use the get_speed function.

# Each motor can be configured to operate at a specific speed. To retrieve the configured speed you use the get_speed function.

# To change the configured speed for a motor you can also provide a speed difference to the change_speed function.
#Â the value returned is the new speed.
